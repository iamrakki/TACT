          Digital credentials are electronic records in form of Digital
          certificates & documents that represent an individual's achievements,
          skills, or qualifications. They serve as a verifiable and secure way
          to showcase a person's educational accomplishments. These credentials
          can include academic degrees, certifications, badges, and other

          Digital credentials are stored on a blockchain or similar secure
          platform, making them tamper-proof and highly resistant to fraud or
          misrepresentation. This ensures that the credentials presented by a
          student are genuine and unaltered.

          Digital credentials can be designed to stack or build upon one
          another, allowing learners to accumulate a series of smaller
          credentials that ultimately lead to a larger qualification or degree.
          This supports flexible and modular learning pathways.
